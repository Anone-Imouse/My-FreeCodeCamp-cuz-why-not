# My-FreeCodeCamp-cuz-why-not
I... don't know what to say. I didn't even know you could do this but it's here... I guess?

Well, you know this is actuaally funny because in my last rep (My-Codepen-cuz-why-not), I said that I would try to link my "...". But the thing is; "..." meant freecodecamp. Isn't it funny? Also, how original am i right, "My-FreeCodeCamp-cuz-why-not" comes right after I release "My-Codepen-cuz-why-not". How original am I?
